# BooFi: Stablecoin-first Multichain DeFi and Open Banking for Emerging Markets with AI

## üåê Overview

BooFi is a cutting-edge platform developed for Wormhole's **Sigma Sprint Hackathon 2024**, designed to bridge the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional private banking within the Latin American (LATAM) fintech ecosystem for accessing capital for freelancers and small to medium sized businessed for the future of work. By leveraging a **Hub and Spoke Money Market** model, BooFi facilitates secure borrowing and lending, enabling seamless cross-border transactions and liquidity management across multiple blockchain networks with a private blockchain for open banking services in LATAM looking to create a spoke with the coming of regional CBDCs and stablecoins in the region.

## üöÄ Features
